The current progress of the project corresponds almost exactly to the target set by the project plan from the RDC.1. Additionally paper publications in the field of overall architecture and QoS compliance methods are currently under review and pending for acceptance. The next step is proving the so far collected and elaborated methods and techniques inside a prototypical implementation. So far the first development for the front end,measurement probes and simple compliance methods has already started.
